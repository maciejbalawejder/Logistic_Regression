# Logistic Regression
'Model of Logistic Regression bulit from scratch. Tested on "Hello world" Titanic dataset from Kaggle.'

## Fixed :
* confusion matrix
* cost
* updating weights 

## To do :
* fix log(0) xin cross entropy
* scalling data
* optimizing model
  * [x] regularization - improves generalization 
  * [x] validation dataset
  * [x] split function 
  * [x] plot learning curve
  * diffrent costs functions 
  * F1 - score
  * learning curve
