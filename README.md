# Logistic Regression
Model of Logistic Regression bulit from scratch in educational purpose(to avoid situtation from the meme above) which tries to be small and clean. It is not complicated model, containing only 115 lines of code, and explaining in depth operation which are going "behind the scenes" when you use libraries like sklearn. 


### Fixed :
* confusion matrix
* cost
* updating weights 

### To do :
* scalling data
* optimizing model
  * [x] regularization - improves generalization 
  * [x] validation dataset
  * [x] split function 
  * [x] plot learning curve
  * [x] F1 - score 
  * k-fold validation set sounds cool
